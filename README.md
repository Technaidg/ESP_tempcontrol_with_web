# ESP_tempcontrol_with_web
A basic esp script that allows you to configure a board to send a signal when a temperature or water pressure go below or above a certain point, using html.
Also supports editing from modbus.

Don't forget to configure the pins you want; and the read analog section math, I left them according to what I used. 

This was made with arduino ide 2.3.7 nightly
